##Detailed
I am provided with the visual assets and a game loop engine; I added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger. I also finished all of the important function. Such as the canvas drawing, the moving, the collision checking, picking up the gem and incresing score method.
